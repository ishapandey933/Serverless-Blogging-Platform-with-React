# Serverless, SEO-Friendly React Blog

This project is an example use case demonstrating how to build a serverless, SEO-friendly blog using React, ButterCMS, and Netlify. The intention behind this project is to showcase the power of serverless architecture in combination with a headless CMS, allowing developers to quickly build and iterate on web applications without worrying about server maintenance, outages, or scaling bottlenecks.

## Project Overview

The blog is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a responsive and interactive frontend.
- **ButterCMS**: A hosted API-based content management system (CMS) that allows you to manage and integrate dynamic content with any programming language or framework.
- **Netlify**: A static site hosting service that provides built-in prerendering for better SEO performance, making it ideal for serverless applications.

## Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: The application is entirely serverless, leveraging the benefits of minimal infrastructure maintenance and scalability.
- **SEO Optimization**: The blog is SEO-friendly, using React Helmet to manage HTML head tags and Netlify's prerendering service for better crawler indexing.
- **Routing**: The blog includes two primary pages: a home page listing all posts and individual post pages. Routing is managed using `react-router`.
- **Content Management**: Blog posts, categories, tags, and authors are managed via ButterCMS, allowing for easy content updates without touching the codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your local machine.
- **Yarn**: Yarn package manager is recommended for managing dependencies and building the project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-serverless-blog.git
   cd react-serverless-blog


2. **Install Dependencies**:
  
   yarn install


3. **Start the Development Server**:
  
   yarn start

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building the Project

To create a production build of the application:


yarn run build

This command will generate the production files in the `build` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the app on Netlify:

1. Sign in to your Netlify account.
2. Drag and drop the `build` folder onto your Netlify dashboard.
3. Enable prerendering in the Netlify app settings for improved SEO.
